<p>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE 
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF 
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>
<b>1. DEFINITIONS<br>
</b>
</p><p>
"Contribution" means:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br>
<br>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br>
<br>
i) changes to the Program, and<br>
<br>
ii) additions to the Program;
</blockquote>
<p>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
 are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are 
separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
 under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of
 the Program.</p>
<p>
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</p>
<p>
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
 are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone 
or when combined with the Program.</p>
<p>
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
Agreement.</p>
<p>
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
including all Contributors.</p>
<p><b><br>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
</b><br>
</p><blockquote>
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and 
object code form.<br>
<br>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
 under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and 
otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in 
source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
 combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the 
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the 
Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed 
Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations 
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed 
hereunder.<br>
<br>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to 
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient 
to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire 
that license before distributing the Program.<br>
<br>
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
license set forth in this Agreement.
<p><b><br>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
</b>
</p><p>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form 
under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br>
<br>
b) its license agreement:<br>
<br>
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions 
of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of 
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br>
<br>
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
 damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br>
<br>
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br>
<br>
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
<blockquote><p>
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br>
<br>
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the 
Program.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
within the Program.</p>
<p>
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>
<p><b><br>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
</b>
</p><p>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities 
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this 
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
 Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering 
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for 
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
 commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial 
Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other 
Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and 
costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other 
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified 
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such 
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the 
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this 
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or 
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an 
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial 
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial 
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor 
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
 Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p>
<p>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
must pay those damages.</p>
<p><b><br>
5. NO WARRANTY<br>
</b>
</p><p>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
 ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES 
OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
 A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program 
and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this 
Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program 
errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, 
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p>
<p><b><br>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
</b>
</p><p>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR 
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED 
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p><b><br>
7. GENERAL<br>
</b>
</p><p>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
 by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program 
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or 
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's 
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation is filed.</p>
<p>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails 
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
 and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after 
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under 
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
 of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's 
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient 
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
<p>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
 only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward 
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
 Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward 
has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the 
initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the 
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate 
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
 version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be 
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was 
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is 
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including 
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in 
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses 
to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, 
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in 
the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p>
<p>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to 
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights 
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. </p>
